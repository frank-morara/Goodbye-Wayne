# Goodbye-Wayne
A card to give my Deceased friend Wayne Namema a Goodbye sendoff and Farewell as well.
Wayne succumbed to death at a tender age on the verge of completing his second year at Kenyatta University.
This is a tribute as well as a sendoff to him because he wanted to build some apps one Day .
